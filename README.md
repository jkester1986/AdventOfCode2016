Advent of Code 2016 puzzle solutions

This is the second year of Advent Of Code, which is a programming challenge over a series of the first 25 days of December. Puzzles have two parts, the second of which is usually (but not always) a pretty quick solve if you figured out the first part. Each day a puzzle releases at midnight, where you have the opportunity to get on the leaderboard (I never made it). I stayed up a few times at midnight, but most times just worked on the puzzle once I got up.

These are my solutions. A few of them had some long run-times,  and I know based on other people's solutions that they can be optimized, but overall I felt pretty good about this year. Finished all but two puzzles day-of, learned some valuable stuff, and had the entire AoC solved before 1 a.m. on Christmas day! (Last year I was stuck on a puzzle a few days past the end)
